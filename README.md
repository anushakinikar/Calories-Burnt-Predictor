# Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of calories burned during physical activities. Leveraging a dataset that includes various parameters such as age, gender, weight, height, duration of activity, heart rate, and type of activity, the model will learn to estimate calorie expenditure.
